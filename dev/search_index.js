Thus for all benchmarking, especially with PDEs, this should be done. Neural network libraries don't make use of mutation effectively except for SimpleChains.jl, so we recommend creating a neural ODE / universal ODE with ZygoteVJP and Lux first, but then check the correctness by moving the implementation over to SimpleChains and if possible EnzymeVJP. This can be an order of magnitude improvement (or more) in many situations over all the previous benchmarks using Zygote and Lux, and thus it's highly recommended in scenarios that require performance.","category":"section"},{"location":"Benchmark/#Vs-Torchdiffeq-1-million-and-less-ODEs","page":"Benchmarks","title":"Vs Torchdiffeq 1 million and less ODEs","text":"A raw ODE solver benchmark showcases >30x performance advantage for DifferentialEquations.jl for ODEs ranging in size from 3 to nearly 1 million.","category":"section"},{"location":"Benchmark/#Vs-Torchdiffeq-on-neural-ODE-training","page":"Benchmarks","title":"Vs Torchdiffeq on neural ODE training","text":"A training benchmark using the spiral ODE from the original neural ODE paper demonstrates a 100x performance advantage for DiffEqFlux in training neural ODEs.","category":"section"},{"location":"Benchmark/#Vs-torchsde-on-small-SDEs","page":"Benchmarks","title":"Vs torchsde on small SDEs","text":"Using the code from torchsde's README, we demonstrated a >70,000x performance advantage over torchsde.

To work around this issue for complicated cases like nested structs,   look into defining p using AbstractArray libraries such as RecursiveArrayTools.jl   or ComponentArrays.jl.\n\nODEForwardSensitivityProblem Syntax\n\nODEForwardSensitivityProblem is similar to an ODEProblem, but takes an AbstractForwardSensitivityAlgorithm that describes how to append the forward sensitivity equation calculation to the time evolution to simultaneously compute the derivative of the solution with respect to parameters.\n\nODEForwardSensitivityProblem(f::SciMLBase.AbstractODEFunction,u0,\n                             tspan,p=nothing;\n                             sensealg::AbstractForwardSensitivityAlgorithm = ForwardSensitivity(),\n                             kwargs...)\n\nOnce constructed, this problem can be used in solve just like any other ODEProblem. The solution can be deconstructed into the ODE solution and sensitivities parts using the extract_local_sensitivities function, with the following dispatches:\n\nextract_local_sensitivities(sol, asmatrix::Val=Val(false)) # Decompose the entire time series\nextract_local_sensitivities(sol, i::Integer, asmatrix::Val=Val(false)) # Decompose sol.u[i]\nextract_local_sensitivities(sol, t::Union{Number,AbstractVector}, asmatrix::Val=Val(false)) # Decompose sol(t)\n\nFor information on the mathematics behind these calculations, consult the sensitivity math page\n\nExample using an ODEForwardSensitivityProblem\n\nTo define a sensitivity problem, simply use the ODEForwardSensitivityProblem type instead of an ODE type. For example, we generate an ODE with the sensitivity equations attached to the Lotka-Volterra equations by:\n\nfunction f(du,u,p,t)\n  du[1] = dx = p[1]*u[1] - p[2]*u[1]*u[2]\n  du[2] = dy = -p[3]*u[2] + u[1]*u[2]\nend\n\np = [1.5,1.0,3.0]\nprob = ODEForwardSensitivityProblem(f,[1.0;1.0],(0.0,10.0),p)\n\nThis generates a problem which the ODE solvers can solve:\n\nsol = solve(prob,DP8())\n\nNote that the solution is the standard ODE system and the sensitivity system combined. We can use the following helper functions to extract the sensitivity information:\n\nx,dp = extract_local_sensitivities(sol)\nx,dp = extract_local_sensitivities(sol,i)\nx,dp = extract_local_sensitivities(sol,t)\n\nIn each case, x is the ODE values and dp is the matrix of sensitivities The first gives the full timeseries of values and dp[i] contains the time series of the sensitivities of all components of the ODE with respect to ith parameter. The second returns the ith time step, while the third interpolates to calculate the sensitivities at time t. For example, if we do:\n\nx,dp = extract_local_sensitivities(sol)\nda = dp[1]\n\nthen da is the timeseries for fracpartial u(t)partial p. We can plot this\n\nplot(sol.t,da',lw=3)\n\ntransposing so that the rows (the timeseries) is plotted.\n\n(Image: Local Sensitivity Solution)\n\nHere we see that there is a periodicity to the sensitivity which matches the periodicity of the Lotka-Volterra solutions. However, as time goes on, the sensitivity increases. This matches the analysis of Wilkins in Sensitivity Analysis for Oscillating Dynamical Systems.\n\nWe can also quickly see that these values are equivalent to those given by automatic differentiation and numerical differentiation through the ODE solver:\n\nusing ForwardDiff, Calculus\nfunction test_f(p)\n  prob = ODEProblem(f,eltype(p).([1.0,1.0]),eltype(p).((0.0,10.0)),p)\n  solve(prob,Vern9(),abstol=1e-14,reltol=1e-14,save_everystep=false)[end]\nend\n\np = [1.5,1.0,3.0]\nfd_res = ForwardDiff.jacobian(test_f,p)\ncalc_res = Calculus.finite_difference_jacobian(test_f,p)\n\nHere we just checked the derivative at the end point.\n\nInternal representation of the Solution\n\nFor completeness, we detail the internal representation. When using ForwardDiffSensitivity, the representation is with Dual numbers under the standard interpretation. The values for the ODE's solution at time i are the ForwardDiff.value.(sol.u[i]) portions, and the derivative with respect to parameter j is given by ForwardDiff.partials.(sol.u[i])[j].\n\nWhen using ForwardSensitivity, the solution to the ODE are the first n components of the solution. This means we can grab the matrix of solution values like:\n\nx = sol[1:sol.prob.indvars,:]\n\nSince each sensitivity is a vector of derivatives for each function, the sensitivities are each of size sol.prob.indvars. We can pull out the parameter sensitivities from the solution as follows:\n\nda = sol[sol.prob.indvars+1:sol.prob.indvars*2,:]\ndb = sol[sol.prob.indvars*2+1:sol.prob.indvars*3,:]\ndc = sol[sol.prob.indvars*3+1:sol.prob.indvars*4,:]\n\nThis means that da[1,i] is the derivative of the x(t) by the parameter a at time sol.t[i]. Note that all the functionality available to ODE solutions is available in this case, including interpolations and plot recipes (the recipes will plot the expanded system).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"manual/direct_forward_sensitivity/#SciMLSensitivity.extract_local_sensitivities","page":"Direct Forward Sensitivity Analysis of ODEs","title":"SciMLSensitivity.extract_local_sensitivities","text":"extractlocalsensitivities\n\nExtracts the time series for the local sensitivities from the ODE solution.

Often, this is used in an optimization problem to return the gradient with respect to some cost function. It is equivalent to \"backpropagation\" or reverse-mode automatic differentiation of a differential equation.\n\nUsing adjoint_sensitivities directly lets you do three things. First, it can allow you to be more efficient, since the sensitivity calculation can be done directly on a cost function, avoiding the overhead of building the derivative of the full concretized solution. It can also allow you to be more efficient by directly controlling the forward solve that is then reversed over. Lastly, it allows one to define a continuous cost function on the continuous solution, instead of just at discrete data points.\n\nwarning: Warning\nAdjoint sensitivity analysis functionality requires being able to solve   a differential equation defined by the parameter struct p.

If specific   saving is required, one should solve dense solve(prob,alg), use the   solution in the adjoint, and then sol(ts) interpolate.\n\nMathematical Definition\n\nAdjoint sensitivity analysis finds the gradient of a cost function G defined by the infinitesimal cost over the whole time period (t_0 T), given by the equation:\n\nG(up)=G(u(cdotp))=int_t_0^Tg(u(tp)pt)dt\n\nIt does so by solving the adjoint problem:\n\nfracdlambda^stardt=g_u(u(tp)p)-lambda^star(t)f_u(tu(tp)p)thinspacethinspacethinspacelambda^star(T)=0\n\nand obtaining the sensitivities through the integral:\n\nfracdGdp=int_t_0^Tlambda^star(t)f_p(t)+g_p(t)dt+lambda^star(t_0)u_p(t_0)\n\nAs defined, that cost function only has non-zero values over nontrivial intervals. However, often one may want to include in the cost function loss values at discrete points, for example, matching the data at time points t. In this case, terms of g can be represented by Dirac delta functions, which are then applied to the corresponding lambda^star and fracdGdp equations.\n\nFor more information, see Sensitivity Math Details.\n\nPositional Arguments\n\nsol: the solution from the forward pass of the ODE. Note that if not using a checkpointing sensitivity algorithm, then it's assumed that the (dense) interpolation of the forward solution is of sufficient accuracy for recreating the solution at any time point.\nalg: the algorithm (i.e., DiffEq solver) to use for the solution of the adjoint problem.\n\nKeyword Arguments\n\nt: the time points at which the discrete cost function is to be evaluated. This argument is only required if discrete cost functions are declared.\ng: the continuous instantaneous cost g(upt) at a given time point represented by a Julia function g(u,p,t). This argument is only required if there is a continuous instantaneous cost contribution.\ndgdu_discrete: the partial derivative g_u evaluated at the discrete (Dirac delta) times. If discrete cost values are given, then dgdu_discrete is required.\ndgdp_discrete: the partial derivative g_p evaluated at the discrete (Dirac delta) times.

If g is given, then this term is not required and will be approximated by numerical or (forward-mode) automatic differentiation (via the autojacvec keyword argument in the sensealg) if this term is not given by the user.\nno_start: Says whether the starting time contains data for the sensitivity analysis. This is required because you must have a solution object which contains the starting time for the adjoint method, but if your forward solve had save_start=false then no_start=true should be set.\nabstol: the absolute tolerance of the adjoint solve. Defaults to 1e-3\nreltol: the relative tolerance of the adjoint solve.

Only used if thesol.prob isa SDEProblem`. If not given, this is   computed using automatic differentiation. Note that this inside of the reverse solve SDE then implies automatic   differentiation of a function being automatic differentiated, and nested higher order automatic differentiation   has more restrictions on the function plus some performance disadvantages.\n\ncallback: callback functions to be used in the adjoint solve. Defaults to nothing.\nsensealg: the choice for what adjoint method to use for the reverse solve. Defaults to InterpolatingAdjoint(). See the sensitivity algorithms page for more details.\nkwargs: any extra keyword arguments passed to the adjoint solve.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nFor discrete adjoints where the cost functions only depend on parameters through the ODE solve itself (for example, parameter estimation with L2 loss), use:\n\ndu0,dp = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,alg;t=ts,dgdu_discrete=dg,\n                               sensealg=InterpolatingAdjoint(),\n                               checkpoints=sol.t,kwargs...)\n\nwhere alg is the ODE algorithm to solve the adjoint problem, dgdu_discrete is the jump function, sensealg is the sensitivity algorithm, and ts are the time points for data. dg is given by:\n\ndg(out,u,p,t,i)\n\nwhich is the in-place gradient of the cost functional g at time point ts[i] with u=u(t).\n\nFor continuous functionals, the form is:\n\ndu0,dp = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,alg;dgdu_continuous=dgdu,g=g,\n                               dgdp_continuous = dgdp,\n                               sensealg=InterpolatingAdjoint(),\n                               checkpoints=sol.t,\n                               no_start = false, kwargs...)\n\nfor the cost functional\n\ng(u,p,t)\n\nwith in-place gradient\n\ndgdu(out,u,p,t)\ndgdp(out,u,p,t)\n\nIf the gradient is omitted, i.e.\n\ndu0,dp = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,alg;g=g,kwargs...)\n\nthen we assume dgdp is zero and dgdu will be computed automatically using ForwardDiff or finite differencing, depending on the autodiff setting in the AbstractSensitivityAlgorithm. Note that the keyword arguments are passed to the internal ODE solver for solving the adjoint problem.\n\nnote: Note\nMixing discrete and continuous terms in the cost function is allowed\n\nExamples\n\nExample discrete adjoints on a cost function\n\nIn this example, we will show solving for the adjoint sensitivities of a discrete cost functional. First, let's solve the ODE and get a high quality continuous solution:\n\nfunction f(du,u,p,t)\n  du[1] = dx = p[1]*u[1] - p[2]*u[1]*u[2]\n  du[2] = dy = -p[3]*u[2] + u[1]*u[2]\nend\n\np = [1.5,1.0,3.0]\nprob = ODEProblem(f,[1.0;1.0],(0.0,10.0),p)\nsol = solve(prob,Vern9(),abstol=1e-10,reltol=1e-10)\n\nNow let's calculate the sensitivity of the ell_2 error against 1 at evenly spaced points in time, that is:\n\nL(upt)=sum_i=1^nfracVert1-u(t_ip)Vert^22\n\nfor t_i = 05i. This is the assumption that the data is data[i]=1.0.

This maximizes speed, but at a cost of requiring a dense sol. If it is not possible to hold a dense forward solution in memory, then one can use checkpointing. For example:\n\nts = [0.0,0.2,0.5,0.7]\nsol = solve(prob,Vern9(),saveat=ts)\n\nCreates a non-dense solution with checkpoints at [0.0,0.2,0.5,0.7]. Now we can do:\n\nres = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,Vern9();t=ts,dg_discrete=dg,\n                            sensealg=InterpolatingAdjoint(checkpointing=true))\n\nWhen grabbing a Jacobian value during the backwards solution, it will no longer interpolate to get the value. Instead, it will start a forward solution at the nearest checkpoint to build local interpolants in a way that conserves memory. By default, the checkpoints are at sol.t, but we can override this:\n\nres = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,Vern9();t=ts,dg_discrte=dg,\n                            sensealg=InterpolatingAdjoint(checkpointing=true),\n                            checkpoints = [0.0,0.5])\n\nExample continuous adjoints on an energy functional\n\nIn this case, we'd like to calculate the adjoint sensitivity of the scalar energy functional:\n\nG(up)=int_0^Tfracsum_i=1^nu_i^2(t)2dt\n\nwhich is:\n\ng(u,p,t) = (sum(u).^2) ./ 2\n\nNotice that the gradient of this function with respect to the state u is:\n\nfunction dg(out,u,p,t)\n  out[1]= u[1] + u[2]\n  out[2]= u[1] + u[2]\nend\n\nTo get the adjoint sensitivities, we call:\n\nres = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,Vern9();dg_continuous=dg,g=g,abstol=1e-8,\n                                 reltol=1e-8,iabstol=1e-8,ireltol=1e-8)\n\nNotice that we can check this against autodifferentiation and numerical differentiation as follows:\n\nusing QuadGK\nfunction G(p)\n  tmp_prob = remake(prob,p=p)\n  sol = solve(tmp_prob,Vern9(),abstol=1e-14,reltol=1e-14)\n  res,err = quadgk((t)-> (sum(sol(t)).^2)./2,0.0,10.0,atol=1e-14,rtol=1e-10)\n  res\nend\nres2 = ForwardDiff.gradient(G,[1.5,1.0,3.0])\nres3 = Calculus.gradient(G,[1.5,1.0,3.0])\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"manual/direct_adjoint_sensitivities/#SciMLSensitivity.second_order_sensitivities","page":"Direct Adjoint Sensitivities of Differential Equations","title":"SciMLSensitivity.second_order_sensitivities","text":"H = second_order_sensitivities(loss,prob,alg,args...;\n                               sensealg=ForwardDiffOverAdjoint(InterpolatingAdjoint(autojacvec=ReverseDiffVJP())),\n                               kwargs...)\n\nSecond order sensitivity analysis is used for the fast calculation of Hessian matrices.\n\nwarning: Warning\nAdjoint sensitivity analysis functionality requires being able to solve   a differential equation defined by the parameter struct p.

When we are identifying nonlinear models, we typically do not have the luxury of closed-form, non-iterative solutions, while PEM is easier to adapt to the nonlinear setting.[Larsson]\n\nFundamentally, PEM changes the problem from minimizing a loss based on the simulation performance, to minimizing a loss based on shorter-term predictions. There are several benefits of doing so, and this example will highlight two:\n\nThe loss is often easier to optimize.\nIn addition to an accurate simulator, you also obtain a prediction for the system.\nWith PEM, it's possible to estimate disturbance models.\n\nThe last point will not be illustrated in this tutorial, but we will briefly expand upon it here. Gaussian, zero-mean measurement noise is usually not very hard to handle. Disturbances that affect the state of the system may, however, cause all sorts of havoc on the estimate. Consider wind affecting an aircraft, deriving a statistical and dynamical model of the wind may be doable, but unless you measure the exact wind affecting the aircraft, making use of the model during parameter estimation is impossible. The wind is an unmeasured load disturbance that affects the state of the system through its own dynamics model. Using the techniques illustrated in this tutorial, it's possible to estimate the influence of the wind during the experiment that generated the data and reduce or eliminate the bias it otherwise causes in the parameter estimates.\n\nWe will start by illustrating a common problem with simulation-error minimization. Imagine a pendulum with unknown length that is to be estimated. A small error in the pendulum length causes the frequency of oscillation to change. Over sufficiently large horizon, two sinusoidal signals with different frequencies become close to orthogonal to each other. If some form of squared-error loss is used, the loss landscape will be horribly non-convex in this case, indeed, we will illustrate exactly this below.\n\nAnother case that poses a problem for simulation-error estimation is when the system is unstable or chaotic. A small error in either the initial condition or the parameters may cause the simulation error to diverge and its gradient to become meaningless.\n\nIn both of these examples, we may make use of measurements we have of the evolution of the system to prevent the simulation error from diverging. For instance, if we have measured the angle of the pendulum, we can make use of this measurement to adjust the angle during the simulation to make sure it stays close to the measured angle. Instead of performing a pure simulation, we instead say that we predict the state a while forward in time, given all the measurements until the current time point. By minimizing this prediction rather than the pure simulation, we can often prevent the model error from diverging even though we have a poor initial guess.\n\nWe start by defining a model of the pendulum. The model takes a parameter L corresponding to the length of the pendulum.\n\nimport OrdinaryDiffEq as ODE\nimport Optimization as OPT\nimport OptimizationPolyalgorithms as OPA\nimport Plots\nimport Statistics\nimport DataInterpolations as DI\nimport ForwardDiff as FD\nimport SciMLBase as SMB\n\ntspan = (0.1, 20.0)\ntsteps = range(tspan[1], tspan[2], length = 1000)\n\nu0 = [0.0, 3.0] # Initial angle and angular velocity\n\nfunction simulator(du, u, p, t) # Pendulum dynamics\n    g = 9.82 # Gravitational constant\n    L = p isa Number ? p : p[1] # Length of the pendulum\n    gL = g / L\n    θ = u[1]\n    dθ = u[2]\n    du[1] = dθ\n    du[2] = -gL * sin(θ)\nend\n\nWe assume that the true length of the pendulum is L = 1, and generate some data from this system.\n\nprob = ODE.ODEProblem(simulator, u0, tspan, 1.0) # Simulate with L = 1\nsol = ODE.solve(prob, ODE.Tsit5(), saveat = tsteps, abstol = 1e-8, reltol = 1e-8)\ny = sol[1, :] # This is the data we have available for parameter estimation\nPlots.plot(y, title = \"Pendulum simulation\", label = \"angle\")\n\nWe also define functions that simulate the system and calculate the loss, given a parameter p corresponding to the length.\n\nfunction simulate(p)\n    _prob = ODE.remake(prob, p = p)\n    ODE.solve(_prob, ODE.Tsit5(), saveat = tsteps, abstol = 1e-8, reltol = 1e-8)\nend\n\nfunction simloss(p)\n    yh = simulate(p)\n    if !SMB.successful_retcode(yh.retcode)\n        return Inf\n    end\n    e2 = yh[1, :]\n    e2 .= abs2.(y .- e2)\n    return Statistics.mean(e2)\nend\n\nWe now look at the loss landscape as a function of the pendulum length:\n\nLs = 0.01:0.01:2\nsimlosses = simloss.(Ls)\nfig_loss = Plots.plot(Ls, simlosses, title = \"Loss landscape\", xlabel = \"Pendulum length\",\n    ylabel = \"MSE loss\", lab = \"Simulation loss\")\n\nThis figure is interesting, the loss is of course 0 for the true value L=1, but for values L  1, the overall slope actually points in the wrong direction! Moreover, the loss is oscillatory, indicating that this is a terrible function to optimize, and that we would need a very good initial guess for a local search to converge to the true value. Note, this example is chosen to be one-dimensional in order to allow these kinds of visualizations, and one-dimensional problems are typically not hard to solve, but the reasoning extends to higher-dimensional and harder problems.\n\nWe will now move on to defining a predictor model. Our predictor will be very simple, each time step, we will calculate the error e between the simulated angle theta and the measured angle y. A part of this error will be used to correct the state of the pendulum. The correction we use is linear and looks like Ke = K(y - theta). We have formed what is commonly referred to as a (linear) observer. The Kalman filter is a particular kind of linear observer, where K is calculated based on a statistical model of the disturbances that act on the system. We will stay with a simple, fixed-gain observer here for simplicity.\n\nTo feed the sampled data into the continuous-time simulation, we make use of an interpolator. We also define new functions, predictor that contains the pendulum dynamics with the observer correction, a prediction function that performs the rollout (we're not using the word simulation to not confuse with the setting above) and a loss function.\n\ny_int = DI.LinearInterpolation(y, tsteps)\n\nfunction predictor(du, u, p, t)\n    g = 9.82\n    L, K, y = p # pendulum length, observer gain and measurements\n    gL = g / L\n    θ = u[1]\n    dθ = u[2]\n    yt = y(t)\n    e = yt - θ\n    du[1] = dθ + K * e\n    du[2] = -gL * sin(θ)\nend\n\npredprob = ODE.ODEProblem(predictor, u0, tspan, nothing)\n\nfunction prediction(p)\n    p_full = (p..., y_int)\n    _prob = ODE.remake(predprob, u0 = eltype(p).(u0), p = p_full)\n    ODE.solve(_prob, ODE.Tsit5(), saveat = tsteps, abstol = 1e-8, reltol = 1e-8)\nend\n\nfunction predloss(p)\n    yh = prediction(p)\n    if !SMB.successful_retcode(yh.retcode)\n        return Inf\n    end\n    e2 = yh[1, :]\n    e2 .= abs2.(y .- e2)\n    return Statistics.mean(e2)\nend\n\npredlosses = map(Ls) do L\n    p = (L, 1) # use K = 1\n    predloss(p)\nend\n\nPlots.plot!(Ls, predlosses, lab = \"Prediction loss\")\n\nOnce gain, we look at the loss as a function of the parameter, and this time it looks a lot better. The loss is not convex, but the gradient points in the right direction over a much larger interval. Here, we arbitrarily set the observer gain to K=1, we will later let the optimizer learn this parameter.\n\nFor completeness, we also perform estimation using both losses. We choose an initial guess we know will be hard for the simulation-error minimization just to drive home the point:\n\nL0 = [0.7] # Initial guess of pendulum length\nadtype = OPT.AutoForwardDiff()\noptf = OPT.OptimizationFunction((x, p) -> simloss(x), adtype)\noptprob = OPT.OptimizationProblem(optf, L0)\n\nressim = OPT.solve(optprob, OPA.PolyOpt(),\n    maxiters = 5000)\nysim = simulate(ressim.u)[1, :]\n\nPlots.plot(tsteps, [y ysim], label = [\"Data\" \"Simulation model\"])\n\np0 = [0.7, 1.0] # Initial guess of length and observer gain K\noptf2 = OPT.OptimizationFunction((p, _) -> predloss(p), adtype)\noptprob2 = OPT.OptimizationProblem(optf2, p0)\n\nrespred = OPT.solve(optprob2, OPA.PolyOpt(),\n    maxiters = 5000)\nypred = simulate(respred.u)[1, :]\n\nPlots.plot!(tsteps, ypred, label = \"Prediction model\")\n\nThe estimated parameters (L K) are\n\nrespred.u\n\nNow, we might ask ourselves why we used a correct on the form Ke and didn't instead set the angle in the simulation equal to the measurement. The reason is twofold\n\nIf our prediction of the angle is 100% based on the measurements, the model parameters do not matter for the prediction, and we thus cannot hope to learn their values.\nThe measurement is usually noisy, and we thus want to fuse the predictive power of the model with the information of the measurements. The Kalman filter is an optimal approach to this information fusion under special circumstances (linear model, Gaussian noise).\n\nWe thus let the optimization learn the best value of the observer gain in order to make the best predictions.\n\nAs a last step, we perform the estimation also with some measurement noise to verify that it does something reasonable:\n\nyn = y .+ 0.1f0 .* randn.(Float32)\ny_int = DI.LinearInterpolation(yn, tsteps) # redefine the interpolator to contain noisy measurements\n\noptf = OPT.OptimizationFunction((x, p) -> predloss(x), adtype)\noptprob = OPT.OptimizationProblem(optf, p0)\n\nresprednoise = OPT.solve(optprob, OPA.PolyOpt(),\n    maxiters = 5000)\n\nyprednoise = prediction(resprednoise.u)[1, :]\nPlots.plot!(tsteps, yprednoise, label = \"Prediction model with noisy measurements\")\n\nresprednoise.u\n\nThis example has illustrated basic use of the prediction-error method for parameter estimation. In our example, the measurement we had corresponded directly to one of the states, and coming up with an observer/predictor that worked was not too hard. For more difficult cases, we may opt to use a nonlinear observer, such as an extended Kalman filter (EKF) or design a Kalman filter based on a linearization of the system around some operating point.\n\nAs a last note, there are several other methods available to improve the loss landscape and avoid local minima, such as multiple-shooting. The prediction-error method can easily be combined with most of those methods.\n\nReferences:\n\n[Ljung]: Ljung, Lennart. \"System identification–-Theory for the user\".\n\n[Larsson]: Larsson, Roger, et al. \"Direct prediction-error identification of unstable nonlinear systems applied to flight test data.\"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/hybrid_jump/hybrid_diffeq/#Training-Neural-Networks-in-Hybrid-Differential-Equations","page":"Training Neural Networks in Hybrid Differential Equations","title":"Training Neural Networks in Hybrid Differential Equations","text":"Hybrid differential equations are differential equations with implicit or explicit discontinuities as specified by callbacks.

The subsequent direct sensitivity analysis tutorial showed how to directly use the SciMLSensitivity.jl internals to define and solve the augmented differential equation systems which are used in the automatic differentiation process.\n\nWhile these internal functions give more flexibility, the previous demonstration focused on a case which was possible via automatic differentiation: discrete cost functionals. What is meant by discrete cost functionals is differentiation of a cost which uses a finite number of time points. In the automatic differentiation case, these finite time points are the points returned by solve, i.e. those chosen by the saveat option in the solve call. In the direct adjoint sensitivity tooling, these were the time points chosen by the ts vector.\n\nHowever, there is an expanded set of cost functionals supported by SciMLSensitivity.jl, continuous cost functionals, which are not possible through automatic differentiation interfaces. In an abstract sense, a continuous cost functional is a total cost G defined as the integral of the instantaneous cost g at all time points. In other words, the total cost is defined as:\n\nG(up)=G(u(cdotp))=int_t_0^Tg(u(tp)p)dt\n\nNotice that this cost function cannot accurately be computed using only estimates of u at discrete time points.

This effect of diverging trajectories is known as the butterfly effect, and can be formulated as \"most (small) perturbations on initial conditions or parameters lead to new trajectories diverging exponentially fast from the original trajectory\".\n\nThe latter statement can be roughly translated to the level of sensitivity calculation as follows: \"For most initial conditions, the (homogeneous) tangent solutions grow exponentially fast.\"\n\nTo compute derivatives of an objective langle g rangle_ with respect to the parameters p of a chaotic system, one thus encounters that “traditional” forward and adjoint sensitivity methods diverge because the tangent space diverges with a rate given by the Lyapunov exponent. Taking the average of these derivative can then also fail, i.e., one finds that the average derivative is not the derivative of the average.\n\nAlthough numerically computed chaotic trajectories diverge from the true/original trajectory, the shadowing theorem guarantees that there exists an errorless trajectory with a slightly different initial condition that stays near (“shadows”) the numerically computed one, see, e.g, the blog post or the non-intrusive least squares shadowing paper for more details. Essentially, the idea is to replace the ill-conditioned ODE by a well-conditioned optimization problem. Shadowing methods use the shadowing theorem within a renormalization procedure to distill the long-time effect from the joint observation of the long-time and the butterfly effect.

This is the methodology BacksolveAdjoint When training non-stiff neural ODEs, BacksolveAdjoint with ZygoteVJP is generally the fastest method. Additionally, this method does not require storing the values of any intermediate points and is thus the most memory efficient. However, BacksolveAdjoint is prone to instabilities whenever the Lipschitz constant is sufficiently large, like in stiff equations, PDE discretizations, and many other contexts, so it is not used by default. When training a neural ODE for machine learning applications, the user should try BacksolveAdjoint and see if it is sufficiently accurate on their problem. More details on this topic can be found in Stiff Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n\nNote that SciMLSensitivity's implementation of BacksolveAdjoint includes an extra feature BacksolveAdjoint(checkpointing=true) which mixes checkpointing with BacksolveAdjoint. What this method does is that, at saveat points, values from the forward pass are saved. Since the reverse solve should numerically be the same as the forward pass, issues with divergence of the reverse pass are mitigated by restarting the reverse pass at the saveat value from the forward pass. This reduces the divergence and can lead to better gradients at the cost of higher memory usage due to having to save some values of the forward pass. This can stabilize the adjoint in some applications, but for highly stiff applications the divergence can be too fast for this to work in practice.\n\nTo avoid the issues of backwards solving the ODE, InterpolatingAdjoint, QuadratureAdjoint, and GaussAdjoint utilize information from the forward pass. By default, these methods utilize the continuous solution provided by DifferentialEquations.jl in the calculations of the adjoint pass. QuadratureAdjoint uses this to build a continuous function for the solution of the adjoint equation and then performs an adaptive quadrature via Integrals.jl; GaussAdjoint computes the integrand with a callback that performs adaptive quadrature via Integrals.jl during the adjoint equation solve; InterpolatingAdjoint appends the integrand to the ODE, so it's computed simultaneously to the Lagrange multiplier. When memory is not an issue, we find that the QuadratureAdjoint approach tends to be the most efficient as it has a significantly smaller adjoint differential equation and the quadrature converges very fast, but this form requires holding the full continuous solution of the adjoint which can be a significant burden for large parameter problems. The InterpolatingAdjoint is thus a compromise between memory efficiency and compute efficiency, and is in the same spirit as CVODES. GaussAdjoint combines the advantages of both of these approaaches, having a small adjoint differential equation while not requiring saving the full continuous solution of the adjoint problem.\n\nHowever, if the memory cost of the InterpolatingAdjoint is too high, checkpointing can be used via InterpolatingAdjoint(checkpointing=true). When this is used, the checkpoints default to sol.t of the forward pass (i.e. the saved timepoints usually set by saveat). Then in the adjoint, intervals of sol.t[i-1] to sol.t[i] are re-solved in order to obtain a short interpolation which can be utilized in the adjoints. This at most results in two full solves of the forward pass, but dramatically reduces the computational cost while being a low-memory format. This is the preferred method for highly stiff equations when memory is an issue, i.e. stiff PDEs or large neural DAEs.\n\nFor forward-mode, the ForwardSensitivity is the version that performs the optimize-then-discretize approach. In this case, autojacvec corresponds to the method for computing J*v within the forward sensitivity equations, which is either true or false for whether to use Jacobian-free forward-mode AD (via ForwardDiff.jl) or Jacobian-free numerical differentiation.","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/differential_equation_sensitivities/#Discretize-then-Optimize","page":"Sensitivity Algorithms for Differential Equations with Automatic Differentiation (AD)","title":"Discretize-then-Optimize","text":"In this approach, the discretization is done first and then optimization is done on the discretized system.

The default is false.\n\nFor more details on the vjp choices, please consult the sensitivity algorithms documentation page or the docstrings of the vjp types.\n\nApplicability of Backsolve and Caution\n\nWhen BacksolveAdjoint is applicable, it is a fast method, and requires the least memory. However, one must be cautious because not all ODEs are stable under backwards integration by the majority of ODE solvers. An example of such an equation is the Lorenz equation. Notice that if one solves the Lorenz equation forward and then in reverse with any adaptive time step and non-reversible integrator, then the backwards solution diverges from the forward solution. As a quick demonstration:\n\nusing Sundials\nfunction lorenz(du, u, p, t)\n    du[1] = 10.0 * (u[2] - u[1])\n    du[2] = u[1] * (28.0 - u[3]) - u[2]\n    du[3] = u[1] * u[2] - (8 / 3) * u[3]\nend\nu0 = [1.0; 0.0; 0.0]\ntspan = (0.0, 100.0)\nprob = ODEProblem(lorenz, u0, tspan)\nsol = solve(prob, Tsit5(), reltol = 1e-12, abstol = 1e-12)\nprob2 = ODEProblem(lorenz, sol.u[end], (100.0, 0.0))\nsol = solve(prob, Tsit5(), reltol = 1e-12, abstol = 1e-12)\n@show sol.u[end] - u0 #[-3.22091, -1.49394, 21.3435]\n\nThus, one should check the stability of the backsolve on their type of problem before enabling this method. Additionally, using checkpointing with backsolve can be a low memory way to stabilize it.\n\nFor more details on this topic, see Stiff Neural Ordinary Differential Equations.\n\nCheckpointing\n\nTo improve the numerical stability of the reverse pass, BacksolveAdjoint includes a checkpointing feature. If sol.u is a time series, then whenever a time sol.t is hit while reversing, a callback will replace the reversing ODE portion with sol.u[i]. This nudges the solution back onto the appropriate trajectory and reduces the numerical caused by drift.\n\nSciMLProblem Support\n\nThis sensealg only supports ODEProblems, SDEProblems, and RODEProblems.

In this tutorial, we will show how to make use of the tooling in SciMLSensitivity.jl to differentiate the ODE solvers.\n\nnote: Note\nSciMLSensitivity.jl applies to all equation solvers of the SciML ecosystem, such as linear solvers, nonlinear solvers, nonlinear optimization, and more. This tutorial focuses on differential equations, so please see the other tutorials focused on these other SciMLProblem types as necessary. While the interface works similarly for all problem types, these tutorials will showcase the aspects that are special to a given problem.","category":"section"},{"location":"getting_started/#Setup","page":"Getting Started with SciMLSensitivity: Differentiating ODE Solutions","title":"Setup","text":"Let's first define a differential equation we wish to solve.

One of the simplest ways to do this is via ForwardDiff.jl. All one needs to do is to use the ForwardDiff.jl library to differentiate some function f which uses a differential equation solve inside of it. For example, let's say we want the derivative of the first component of the ODE solution with respect to these quantities at evenly spaced time points of dt = 1. We can compute this via:\n\nimport ForwardDiff as FD\n\nfunction f(x)\n    _prob = ODE.remake(prob, u0 = x[1:2], p = x[3:end])\n    ODE.solve(_prob, ODE.Tsit5(), reltol = 1e-6, abstol = 1e-6, saveat = 1)[1, :]\nend\nx = [u0; p]\ndx = FD.jacobian(f, x)\n\nLet's dig into what this is saying a bit. x is a vector which concatenates the initial condition and parameters, meaning that the first 2 values are the initial conditions and the last 4 are the parameters. We use the remake function to build a function f(x) which uses these new initial conditions and parameters to solve the differential equation and return the time series of the first component.\n\nThen ForwardDiff.jacobian(f,x) computes the Jacobian of f with respect to x. The output dx[i,j] corresponds to the derivative of the solution of the first component at time t=j-1 with respect to x[i]. For example, dx[3,2] is the derivative of the first component of the solution at time t=1 with respect to p[1].\n\nnote: Note\nSince the global error is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the local error, we use accuracies of 1e-6 (instead of the default 1e-3) to get reasonable sensitivities","category":"section"},{"location":"getting_started/#Reverse-Mode-Automatic-Differentiation","page":"Getting Started with SciMLSensitivity: Differentiating ODE Solutions","title":"Reverse-Mode Automatic Differentiation","text":"The solve function is automatically compatible with AD systems like Zygote.jl and thus there is no machinery that is necessary to use other than to put solve inside a function that is differentiated by Zygote.

Neural networks can be all or part of the model. They can be around the differential equation, in the cost function, or inside the differential equation. Neural networks representing unknown portions of the model or functions can go anywhere you have uncertainty in the form of the scientific simulator. Forward sensitivity and adjoint equations are automatically generated with checkpointing and stabilization to ensure it works for large stiff equations, while specializations on static objects allows for high efficiency on small equations. For an overview of the topic with applications, consult the paper Universal Differential Equations for Scientific Machine Learning.\n\nYou can efficiently use the package for:\n\nParameter estimation of scientific models (ODEs, SDEs, DDEs, DAEs, etc.)\nNeural ODEs, Neural SDE, Neural DAEs, Neural DDEs, etc.\nNonlinear optimal control, including training neural controllers\n(Stiff) universal ordinary differential equations (universal ODEs)\nUniversal stochastic differential equations (universal SDEs)\nUniversal delay differential equations (universal DDEs)\nUniversal partial differential equations (universal PDEs)\nUniversal jump stochastic differential equations (universal jump diffusions)\nHybrid universal differential equations (universal DEs with event handling)\n\nwith high order, adaptive, implicit, GPU-accelerated, Newton-Krylov, etc. methods. For examples, please refer to the DiffEqFlux release blog post (which we try to keep updated for changes to the libraries). Additional demonstrations, like neural PDEs and neural jump SDEs, can be found at this blog post (among many others!). All these features are only part of the advantage, as this library routinely benchmarks orders of magnitude faster than competing libraries like torchdiffeq. Use with GPUs is highly optimized by recompiling the solvers to GPUs to remove all CPU-GPU data transfers, while use with CPUs uses specialized kernels for accelerating differential equation solves.\n\nMany training techniques are supported by this package, including:\n\nOptimize-then-discretize (backsolve adjoints, checkpointed adjoints, quadrature adjoints)\nDiscretize-then-optimize (forward and reverse mode discrete sensitivity analysis)\nThis is a generalization of ANODE and ANODEv2 to all DifferentialEquations.jl ODE solvers\nHybrid approaches (adaptive time stepping + AD for adaptive discretize-then-optimize)\nO(1) memory backprop of ODEs via BacksolveAdjoint, and Virtual Brownian Trees for O(1) backprop of SDEs\nContinuous adjoints for integral loss functions\nProbabilistic programming and variational inference on ODEs/SDEs/DAEs/DDEs/hybrid equations etc. is provided by integration with Turing.jl and Gen.jl.
