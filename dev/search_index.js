There are three main ways to partition our data when using a training algorithm like gradient descent: stochastic, batching and mini-batching. Stochastic gradient descent trains on a single random data point each epoch. This allows for the neural network to better converge to the global minimum even on noisy data but is computationally inefficient. Batch gradient descent trains on the whole data set each epoch and while computationally efficient is prone to converging to local minima. Mini-batching combines both of these advantages and by training on a small random \"mini-batch\" of the data each epoch can converge to the global minimum while remaining more computationally efficient than stochastic descent. Typically we do this by randomly selecting subsets of the data each epoch and use this subset to train on. We can also pre-batch the data by creating an iterator holding these randomly selected batches before beginning to train. The proper size for the batch can be determined experimentally. Let us see how to do this with Julia.

In many cases this is used in an optimization problem to return the gradient with respect to some cost function. It is equivalent to \"backpropagation\" or reverse-mode automatic differentiation of a differential equation.\n\nUsing adjoint_sensitivities directly let's you do three things. One it can allow you to be more efficient, since the sensitivity calculation can be done directly on a cost function, avoiding the overhead of building the derivative of the full concretized solution. It can also allow you to be more efficient by directly controlling the forward solve that is then reversed over. Lastly, it allows one to define a continuous cost function on the continuous solution, instead of just at discrete data points.\n\nwarning: Warning\nAdjoint sensitivity analysis functionality requires being able to solve   a differential equation defined by the parameter struct p. Thus while   DifferentialEquations.jl can support any parameter struct type, usage   with adjoint sensitivity analysis requires that p could be a valid   type for being the initial condition u0 of an array. This means that   many simple types, such as Tuples and NamedTuples, will work as   parameters in normal contexts but will fail during adjoint differentiation.   To work around this issue for complicated cases like nested structs, look   into defining p using AbstractArray libraries such as RecursiveArrayTools.jl    or ComponentArrays.jl so that p is an AbstractArray with a concrete element type.\n\nwarning: Warning\nNon-checkpointed InterpolatingAdjoint and QuadratureAdjoint sensealgs   require that the forward solution sol(t) has an accurate dense   solution unless checkpointing is used. This means that you should   not use solve(prob,alg,saveat=ts) unless checkpointing. If specific   saving is required, one should solve dense solve(prob,alg), use the   solution in the adjoint, and then sol(ts) interpolate.\n\nSyntax\n\nThere are two forms. For discrete adjoints, the form is:\n\ndu0,dp = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,alg,dg,ts;sensealg=InterpolatingAdjoint(),\n                               checkpoints=sol.t,kwargs...)\n\nwhere alg is the ODE algorithm to solve the adjoint problem, dg is the jump function, sensealg is the sensitivity algorithm, and ts is the time points for data. dg is given by:\n\ndg(out,u,p,t,i)\n\nwhich is the in-place gradient of the cost functional g at time point ts[i] with u=u(t).\n\nFor continuous functionals, the form is:\n\ndu0,dp = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,alg,g,nothing,(dgdu,dgdp);sensealg=InterpolatingAdjoint(),\n                               checkpoints=sol.t,,kwargs...)\n\nfor the cost functional\n\ng(u,p,t)\n\nwith in-place gradient\n\ndgdu(out,u,p,t)\ndgdp(out,u,p,t)\n\nIf the gradient is omitted, i.e.\n\ndu0,dp = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,alg,g,nothing;kwargs...)\n\nthen we assume dgdp is zero and dgdu will be computed automatically using ForwardDiff or finite differencing, depending on the autodiff setting in the AbstractSensitivityAlgorithm. Note that the keyword arguments are passed to the internal ODE solver for solving the adjoint problem.\n\nExample discrete adjoints on a cost function\n\nIn this example we will show solving for the adjoint sensitivities of a discrete cost functional. First let's solve the ODE and get a high quality continuous solution:\n\nfunction f(du,u,p,t)\n  du[1] = dx = p[1]*u[1] - p[2]*u[1]*u[2]\n  du[2] = dy = -p[3]*u[2] + u[1]*u[2]\nend\n\np = [1.5,1.0,3.0]\nprob = ODEProblem(f,[1.0;1.0],(0.0,10.0),p)\nsol = solve(prob,Vern9(),abstol=1e-10,reltol=1e-10)\n\nNow let's calculate the sensitivity of the ell_2 error against 1 at evenly spaced points in time, that is:\n\nL(upt)=sum_i=1^nfracVert1-u(t_ip)Vert^22\n\nfor t_i = 05i. This is the assumption that the data is data[i]=1.0. For this function, notice we have that:\n\nbeginaligned\ndg_1=1-u_1 \r\ndg_2=1-u_2 \r\n quad vdots\nendaligned\n\nand thus:\n\ndg(out,u,p,t,i) = (out.=1.0.-u)\n\nAlso, we can omit dgdp, because the cost function doesn't dependent on p. If we had data, we'd just replace 1.0 with data[i]. To get the adjoint sensitivities, call:\n\nts = 0:0.5:10\nres = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,Vern9(),dg,ts,abstol=1e-14,\n                            reltol=1e-14)\n\nThis is super high accuracy. As always, there's a tradeoff between accuracy and computation time. We can check this almost exactly matches the autodifferentiation and numerical differentiation results:\n\nusing ForwardDiff,Calculus,Tracker\nfunction G(p)\n  tmp_prob = remake(prob,u0=convert.(eltype(p),prob.u0),p=p)\n  sol = solve(tmp_prob,Vern9(),abstol=1e-14,reltol=1e-14,saveat=ts,\n              sensealg=SensitivityADPassThrough())\n  A = convert(Array,sol)\n  sum(((1 .- A).^2)./2)\nend\nG([1.5,1.0,3.0])\nres2 = ForwardDiff.gradient(G,[1.5,1.0,3.0])\nres3 = Calculus.gradient(G,[1.5,1.0,3.0])\nres4 = Tracker.gradient(G,[1.5,1.0,3.0])\nres5 = ReverseDiff.gradient(G,[1.5,1.0,3.0])\n\nand see this gives the same values.\n\nExample controlling adjoint method choices and checkpointing\n\nIn the previous examples, all calculations were done using the interpolating method. This maximizes speed but at a cost of requiring a dense sol. If it is not possible to hold a dense forward solution in memory, then one can use checkpointing. For example:\n\nts = [0.0,0.2,0.5,0.7]\nsol = solve(prob,Vern9(),saveat=ts)\n\nCreates a non-dense solution with checkpoints at [0.0,0.2,0.5,0.7]. Now we can do:\n\nres = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,Vern9(),dg,ts,\n                            sensealg=InterpolatingAdjoint(checkpointing=true))\n\nWhen grabbing a Jacobian value during the backwards solution, it will no longer interpolate to get the value. Instead, it will start a forward solution at the nearest checkpoint to build local interpolants in a way that conserves memory. By default the checkpoints are at sol.t, but we can override this:\n\nres = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,Vern9(),dg,ts,\n                            sensealg=InterpolatingAdjoint(checkpointing=true),\n                            checkpoints = [0.0,0.5])\n\nExample continuous adjoints on an energy functional\n\nIn this case we'd like to calculate the adjoint sensitivity of the scalar energy functional:\n\nG(up)=int_0^Tfracsum_i=1^nu_i^2(t)2dt\n\nwhich is:\n\ng(u,p,t) = (sum(u).^2) ./ 2\n\nNotice that the gradient of this function with respect to the state u is:\n\nfunction dg(out,u,p,t)\n  out[1]= u[1] + u[2]\n  out[2]= u[1] + u[2]\nend\n\nTo get the adjoint sensitivities, we call:\n\nres = adjoint_sensitivities(sol,Vern9(),g,nothing,dg,abstol=1e-8,\n                                 reltol=1e-8,iabstol=1e-8,ireltol=1e-8)\n\nNotice that we can check this against autodifferentiation and numerical differentiation as follows:\n\nusing QuadGK\nfunction G(p)\n  tmp_prob = remake(prob,p=p)\n  sol = solve(tmp_prob,Vern9(),abstol=1e-14,reltol=1e-14)\n  res,err = quadgk((t)-> (sum(sol(t)).^2)./2,0.0,10.0,atol=1e-14,rtol=1e-10)\n  res\nend\nres2 = ForwardDiff.gradient(G,[1.5,1.0,3.0])\nres3 = Calculus.gradient(G,[1.5,1.0,3.0])\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"manual/direct_adjoint_sensitivities/#Second-Order-Adjoint-Sensitivities","page":"Direct Adjoint Sensitivities of Differential Equations","title":"Second Order Adjoint Sensitivities","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/direct_adjoint_sensitivities/","page":"Direct Adjoint Sensitivities of Differential Equations","title":"Direct Adjoint Sensitivities of Differential Equations","text":"second_order_sensitivities\nsecond_order_sensitivity_product","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/direct_adjoint_sensitivities/#DiffEqSensitivity.second_order_sensitivities","page":"Direct Adjoint Sensitivities of Differential Equations","title":"DiffEqSensitivity.second_order_sensitivities","text":"H = secondordersensitivities(loss,prob,alg,args...;                                sensealg=ForwardDiffOverAdjoint(InterpolatingAdjoint(autojacvec=ReverseDiffVJP())),                                kwargs...)\n\nSecond order sensitivity analysis is used for the fast calculation of Hessian matrices.\n\nwarning: Warning\nAdjoint sensitivity analysis functionality requires being able to solve   a differential equation defined by the parameter struct p.

To work around this issue for complicated cases like nested structs,    look into defining p using AbstractArray libraries such as RecursiveArrayTools.jl    or ComponentArrays.jl.\n\nODEForwardSensitivityProblem Syntax\n\nODEForwardSensitivityProblem is similar to an ODEProblem, but takes an AbstractForwardSensitivityAlgorithm that describes how to append the forward sensitivity equation calculation to the time evolution to simultaneously compute the derivative of the solution with respect to parameters.\n\nODEForwardSensitivityProblem(f::SciMLBase.AbstractODEFunction,u0,\n                             tspan,p=nothing,\n                             sensealg::AbstractForwardSensitivityAlgorithm = ForwardSensitivity();\n                             kwargs...)\n\nOnce constructed, this problem can be used in solve just like any other ODEProblem.  The solution can be deconstructed into the ODE solution and sensitivities parts using the extract_local_sensitivities function, with the following dispatches:\n\nextract_local_sensitivities(sol, asmatrix::Val=Val(false)) # Decompose the entire time series\nextract_local_sensitivities(sol, i::Integer, asmatrix::Val=Val(false)) # Decompose sol[i]\nextract_local_sensitivities(sol, t::Union{Number,AbstractVector}, asmatrix::Val=Val(false)) # Decompose sol(t)\n\nFor information on the mathematics behind these calculations, consult the sensitivity math page\n\nExample using an ODEForwardSensitivityProblem\n\nTo define a sensitivity problem, simply use the ODEForwardSensitivityProblem type instead of an ODE type. For example, we generate an ODE with the sensitivity equations attached for the Lotka-Volterra equations by:\n\nfunction f(du,u,p,t)\n  du[1] = dx = p[1]*u[1] - p[2]*u[1]*u[2]\n  du[2] = dy = -p[3]*u[2] + u[1]*u[2]\nend\n\np = [1.5,1.0,3.0]\nprob = ODEForwardSensitivityProblem(f,[1.0;1.0],(0.0,10.0),p)\n\nThis generates a problem which the ODE solvers can solve:\n\nsol = solve(prob,DP8())\n\nNote that the solution is the standard ODE system and the sensitivity system combined. We can use the following helper functions to extract the sensitivity information:\n\nx,dp = extract_local_sensitivities(sol)\nx,dp = extract_local_sensitivities(sol,i)\nx,dp = extract_local_sensitivities(sol,t)\n\nIn each case, x is the ODE values and dp is the matrix of sensitivities The first gives the full timeseries of values and dp[i] contains the time series of the sensitivities of all components of the ODE with respect to ith parameter. The second returns the ith time step, while the third interpolates to calculate the sensitivities at time t. For example, if we do:\n\nx,dp = extract_local_sensitivities(sol)\nda = dp[1]\n\nthen da is the timeseries for fracpartial u(t)partial p. We can plot this\n\nplot(sol.t,da',lw=3)\n\ntransposing so that the rows (the timeseries) is plotted.\n\n(Image: Local Sensitivity Solution)\n\nHere we see that there is a periodicity to the sensitivity which matches the periodicity of the Lotka-Volterra solutions. However, as time goes on the sensitivity increases. This matches the analysis of Wilkins in Sensitivity Analysis for Oscillating Dynamical Systems.\n\nWe can also quickly see that these values are equivalent to those given by automatic differentiation and numerical differentiation through the ODE solver:\n\nusing ForwardDiff, Calculus\nfunction test_f(p)\n  prob = ODEProblem(f,eltype(p).([1.0,1.0]),eltype(p).((0.0,10.0)),p)\n  solve(prob,Vern9(),abstol=1e-14,reltol=1e-14,save_everystep=false)[end]\nend\n\np = [1.5,1.0,3.0]\nfd_res = ForwardDiff.jacobian(test_f,p)\ncalc_res = Calculus.finite_difference_jacobian(test_f,p)\n\nHere we just checked the derivative at the end point.\n\nInternal representation of the Solution\n\nFor completeness, we detail the internal representation. When using ForwardDiffSensitivity, the representation is with Dual numbers under the standard interpretation. The values for the ODE's solution at time i are the ForwardDiff.value.(sol[i]) portions, and the derivative with respect to parameter j is given by ForwardDiff.partials.(sol[i])[j].\n\nWhen using ForwardSensitivity, the solution to the ODE are the first n components of the solution. This means we can grab the matrix of solution values like:\n\nx = sol[1:sol.prob.indvars,:]\n\nSince each sensitivity is a vector of derivatives for each function, the sensitivities are each of size sol.prob.indvars.

The default is false.\n\nFor more details on the vjp choices, please consult the sensitivity algorithms documentation page or the docstrings of the vjp types.\n\nApplicability of Backsolve and Caution\n\nWhen BacksolveAdjoint is applicable, it is a fast method and requires the least memory. However, one must be cautious because not all ODEs are stable under backwards integration by the majority of ODE solvers. An example of such an equation is the Lorenz equation. Notice that if one solves the Lorenz equation forward and then in reverse with any adaptive time step and non-reversible integrator, then the backwards solution diverges from the forward solution. As a quick demonstration:\n\nusing Sundials\nfunction lorenz(du,u,p,t)\n du[1] = 10.0*(u[2]-u[1])\n du[2] = u[1]*(28.0-u[3]) - u[2]\n du[3] = u[1]*u[2] - (8/3)*u[3]\nend\nu0 = [1.0;0.0;0.0]\ntspan = (0.0,100.0)\nprob = ODEProblem(lorenz,u0,tspan)\nsol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),reltol=1e-12,abstol=1e-12)\nprob2 = ODEProblem(lorenz,sol[end],(100.0,0.0))\nsol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),reltol=1e-12,abstol=1e-12)\n@show sol[end]-u0 #[-3.22091, -1.49394, 21.3435]\n\nThus one should check the stability of the backsolve on their type of problem before enabling this method. Additionally, using checkpointing with backsolve can be a low memory way to stabilize it.\n\nFor more details on this topic, see  Stiff Neural Ordinary Differential Equations.\n\nCheckpointing\n\nTo improve the numerical stability of the reverse pass, BacksolveAdjoint includes a checkpointing feature. If sol.u is a time series, then whenever a time sol.t is hit while reversing, a callback will replace the reversing ODE portion with sol.u[i]. This nudges the solution back onto the appropriate trajectory and reduces the numerical caused by drift.\n\nSciMLProblem Support\n\nThis sensealg only supports ODEProblems, SDEProblems, and RODEProblems.

The necessary correction between Ito and Stratonovich integrals is computed under the hood in the DiffEqSensitivity package.","category":"page"},{"location":"optimal_control/SDE_control/","page":"Controlling Stochastic Differential Equations","title":"Controlling Stochastic Differential Equations","text":"# optimize the parameters for a few epochs with ADAM on time span Nint\nopt = ADAM(myparameters.lr)\nlist_plots = []\nlosses = []\nfor epoch in 1:myparameters.epochs\n  println(\"epoch: $epoch / $(myparameters.epochs)\")\n  local u0 = prepare_initial(myparameters.dt, myparameters.numtraj)\n  _dy, back = @time Zygote.pullback(p -> loss(p, u0, prob, myparameters,\n    sensealg=BacksolveAdjoint()\n  ), p_nn)\n  @show _dy\n  gs = @time back(one(_dy))[1]\n  # store loss\n  push!(losses, _dy)\n  if (epoch % myparameters.epochs == 0) || (epoch == 1)\n    # plot/store every xth epoch\n    @info \"plotting..\"\n    local u0 = prepare_initial(myparameters.dt, myparameters.numtrajplot)\n    pl, test_loss = visualize(p_nn, u0, prob, myparameters)\n    println(\"Loss (epoch: $epoch): $test_loss\")\n    display(pl)\n    push!(list_plots, pl)\n  end\n  Flux.Optimise.update!(opt, p_nn, gs)\n  println(\"\")\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"optimal_control/SDE_control/","page":"Controlling Stochastic Differential Equations","title":"Controlling Stochastic Differential Equations","text":"(Image: Evolution of the fidelity as a function of time)","category":"page"},{"location":"optimal_control/SDE_control/#References","page":"Controlling Stochastic Differential Equations","title":"References","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"optimal_control/SDE_control/","page":"Controlling Stochastic Differential Equations","title":"Controlling Stochastic Differential Equations","text":"[1] Schäfer, Frank, Pavel Sekatski, Martin Koppenhöfer, Christoph Bruder, and Michal Kloc. \"Control of stochastic quantum dynamics by differentiable programming.\" Machine Learning: Science and Technology 2, no. 3 (2021): 035004.","category":"page"},{"location":"training_tips/multiple_nn/#Simultaneous-Fitting-of-Multiple-Neural-Networks","page":"Simultaneous Fitting of Multiple Neural Networks","title":"Simultaneous Fitting of Multiple Neural Networks","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"training_tips/multiple_nn/","page":"Simultaneous Fitting of Multiple Neural Networks","title":"Simultaneous Fitting of Multiple Neural Networks","text":"In many cases users are interested in fitting multiple neural networks or parameters simultaneously.
