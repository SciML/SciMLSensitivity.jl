```julia
ForwardSensitivity{CS, AD, FDT} <: AbstractForwardSensitivityAlgorithm{CS, AD, FDT}
```

An implementation of continuous forward sensitivity analysis for propagating
derivatives by solving the extended ODE. When used within adjoint differentiation
(i.e. via Zygote), this will cause forward differentiation of the `solve` call
within the reverse-mode automatic differentiation environment.

## Constructor

```julia
ForwardSensitivity(;
                   chunk_size = 0, autodiff = true,
                   diff_type = Val{:central},
                   autojacvec = autodiff,
                   autojacmat = false)
```

## Keyword Arguments

  - `autodiff`: Use automatic differentiation in the internal sensitivity algorithm
    computations. Default is `true`.
  - `chunk_size`: Chunk size for forward mode differentiation if full Jacobians are
    built (`autojacvec=false` and `autodiff=true`). Default is `0` for automatic
    choice of chunk size.
  - `autojacvec`: Calculate the Jacobian-vector product via automatic
    differentiation with special seeding.
  - `diff_type`: The method used by FiniteDiff.jl for constructing the Jacobian
    if the full Jacobian is required with `autodiff=false`.

Further details:

  - If `autodiff=true` and `autojacvec=true`, then the one chunk `J*v` forward-mode
    directional derivative calculation trick is used to compute the product without
    constructing the Jacobian (via ForwardDiff.jl).
  - If `autodiff=false` and `autojacvec=true`, then the numerical direction derivative
    trick `(f(x+epsilon*v)-f(x))/epsilon` is used to compute `J*v` without constructing
    the Jacobian.
  - If `autodiff=true` and `autojacvec=false`, then the Jacobian is constructed via
    chunked forward-mode automatic differentiation (via ForwardDiff.jl).
  - If `autodiff=false` and `autojacvec=false`, then the Jacobian is constructed via
    finite differences via FiniteDiff.jl.

## SciMLProblem Support

This `sensealg` only supports `ODEProblem`s without callbacks (events).

```julia
BacksolveAdjoint{CS, AD, FDT, VJP} <: AbstractAdjointSensitivityAlgorithm{CS, AD, FDT}
```

An implementation of adjoint sensitivity analysis using a backwards solution of the ODE.
By default, this algorithm will use the values from the forward pass to perturb the
backwards solution to the correct spot, allowing reduced memory (O(1) memory). Checkpointing
stabilization is included for additional numerical stability over the naive implementation.

## Constructor

                 autojacvec = nothing,
                 checkpointing = true, noisemixing = false)
```

## Keyword Arguments

  - `autodiff`: Use automatic differentiation for constructing the Jacobian
    if the Jacobian needs to be constructed.  Defaults to `true`.

  - `chunk_size`: Chunk size for forward-mode differentiation if full Jacobians are
    built (`autojacvec=false` and `autodiff=true`). Default is `0` for automatic
    choice of chunk size.
  - `diff_type`: The method used by FiniteDiff.jl for constructing the Jacobian
    if the full Jacobian is required with `autodiff=false`.
  - `autojacvec`: Calculate the vector-Jacobian product (`J'*v`) via automatic
    differentiation with special seeding. The total set of choices are:

      + `nothing`: uses an automatic algorithm to automatically choose the vjp.
        This is the default and recommended for most users.
      + `false`: the Jacobian is constructed via FiniteDiff.jl
      + `true`: the Jacobian is constructed via ForwardDiff.jl
      + `TrackerVJP`: Uses Tracker.jl for the vjp.
      + `ZygoteVJP`: Uses Zygote.jl for the vjp.
      + `EnzymeVJP`: Uses Enzyme.jl for the vjp.
      + `ReverseDiffVJP(compile=false)`: Uses ReverseDiff.jl for the vjp. `compile`
        is a boolean for whether to precompile the tape, which should only be done
        if there are no branches (`if` or `while` statements) in the `f` function.
  - `checkpointing`: whether checkpointing is enabled for the reverse pass. Defaults
    to `true`.
  - `noisemixing`: Handle noise processes that are not of the form `du[i] = f(u[i])`.
    For example, to compute the sensitivities of an SDE with diagonal diffusion

    ```julia
    function g_mixing!(du, u, p, t)
        du[1] = p[3] * u[1] + p[4] * u[2]
        du[2] = p[3] * u[1] + p[4] * u[2]
        nothing
    end
    ```

    correctly, `noisemixing=true` must be enabled. The default is `false`.

For more details on the vjp choices, please consult the sensitivity algorithms
documentation page or the docstrings of the vjp types.

## Applicability of Backsolve and Caution

When `BacksolveAdjoint` is applicable, it is a fast method, and requires the least memory.
However, one must be cautious because not all ODEs are stable under backwards integration
by the majority of ODE solvers. An example of such an equation is the Lorenz equation.
Notice that if one solves the Lorenz equation forward and then in reverse with any
adaptive time step and non-reversible integrator, then the backwards solution diverges
from the forward solution. As a quick demonstration:

```julia
using Sundials
function lorenz(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = 10.0 * (u[2] - u[1])
    du[2] = u[1] * (28.0 - u[3]) - u[2]
    du[3] = u[1] * u[2] - (8 / 3) * u[3]
end
u0 = [1.0; 0.0; 0.0]
tspan = (0.0, 100.0)
prob = ODEProblem(lorenz, u0, tspan)
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5(), reltol = 1e-12, abstol = 1e-12)
prob2 = ODEProblem(lorenz, sol.u[end], (100.0, 0.0))
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5(), reltol = 1e-12, abstol = 1e-12)
@show sol.u[end] - u0 #[-3.22091, -1.49394, 21.3435]
```

Thus, one should check the stability of the backsolve on their type of problem before
enabling this method. Additionally, using checkpointing with backsolve can be a
low memory way to stabilize it.

For more details on this topic, see
[Stiff Neural Ordinary Differential Equations](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0060697).

## Checkpointing

To improve the numerical stability of the reverse pass, `BacksolveAdjoint` includes a checkpointing
feature. If `sol.u` is a time series, then whenever a time `sol.t` is hit while reversing, a callback
will replace the reversing ODE portion with `sol.u[i]`. This nudges the solution back onto the appropriate
trajectory and reduces the numerical caused by drift.

## SciMLProblem Support

This `sensealg` only supports `ODEProblem`s, `SDEProblem`s, and `RODEProblem`s. This `sensealg` supports
callback functions (events).

### Disclaimer for `SDEProblem`s

The runtime of this algorithm is in O(n^2) for diagonal-noise SDEs until issue #854 is solved.

        nothing
    end
    ```

    correctly, `noisemixing=true` must be enabled. The default is `false`.

For more details on the vjp choices, please consult the sensitivity algorithms
documentation page or the docstrings of the vjp types.

## Checkpointing

To reduce the memory usage of the reverse pass, `InterpolatingAdjoint` includes a checkpointing
feature. If `sol` is `dense`, checkpointing is ignored and the continuous solution is used for
calculating `u(t)` at arbitrary time points. If `checkpointing=true` and `sol` is not `dense`,
then dense intervals between `sol.t[i]` and `sol.t[i+1]` are reconstructed on-demand for calculating
`u(t)` at arbitrary time points. This reduces the total memory requirement to only the cost of
holding the dense solution over the largest time interval (in terms of number of required steps).
The total compute cost is no more than double the original forward compute cost.

TrackerAdjoint <: AbstractAdjointSensitivityAlgorithm{nothing, true, nothing}

An implementation of discrete adjoint sensitivity analysis
using the Tracker.jl tracing-based AD. Supports in-place functions through
an Array of Structs formulation, and supports out of place through struct of
arrays.

## Constructor

```julia
TrackerAdjoint()

## SciMLProblem Support

This `sensealg` supports any `DEProblem` if the algorithm is `SciMLBase.isautodifferentiable`
Compatible with a limited subset of `AbstractArray` types for `u0`, including `CuArrays`.

!!! warn

    TrackerAdjoint is incompatible with Stiff ODE solvers using forward-mode automatic
    differentiation for the Jacobians. Thus, for example, `TRBDF2()` will error. Instead,
    use `autodiff=false`, i.e. `TRBDF2(autodiff=false)`. This will only remove the
    forward-mode automatic differentiation of the Jacobian construction, not the reverse-mode
    AD usage, and thus performance will still be nearly the same, though Jacobian accuracy
    may suffer which could cause more steps to be required.

```

An implementation of the discrete, forward-mode
[least squares shadowing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0159) (LSS) method. LSS replaces
the ill-conditioned initial value problem (`ODEProblem`) for chaotic systems by a
well-conditioned least-squares problem. This allows for computing sensitivities of
long-time averaged quantities with respect to the parameters of the `ODEProblem`. The
computational cost of LSS scales as (number of states x number of time steps). Converges
to the correct sensitivity at a rate of `T^(-1/2)`, where `T` is the time of the trajectory.
See `NILSS()` and `NILSAS()` for a more efficient non-intrusive formulation.

## Constructor

```julia
ForwardLSS(;
           chunk_size = 0, autodiff = true,
           diff_type = Val{:central},
           LSSregularizer = TimeDilation(10.0, 0.0, 0.0),
           g = nothing)
```

## Keyword Arguments

  - `autodiff`: Use automatic differentiation for constructing the Jacobian
    if the Jacobian needs to be constructed.  Defaults to `true`.

  - `chunk_size`: Chunk size for forward-mode differentiation if full Jacobians are
    built (`autojacvec=false` and `autodiff=true`). Default is `0` for automatic
    choice of chunk size.
  - `diff_type`: The method used by FiniteDiff.jl for constructing the Jacobian
    if the full Jacobian is required with `autodiff=false`.
  - `LSSregularizer`: Using `LSSregularizer`, one can choose between three different
    regularization routines. The default choice is `TimeDilation(10.0,0.0,0.0)`.

      + `CosWindowing()`: cos windowing of the time grid, i.e. the time grid (saved
        time steps) is transformed using a cosine.
      + `Cos2Windowing()`: cos^2 windowing of the time grid.
      + `TimeDilation(alpha::Number,t0skip::Number,t1skip::Number)`: Corresponds to
        a time dilation. `alpha` controls the weight. `t0skip` and `t1skip` indicate
        the times truncated at the beginning and end of the trajectory, respectively.
  - `g`: instantaneous objective function of the long-time averaged objective.

## SciMLProblem Support

This `sensealg` only supports `ODEProblem`s. This `sensealg` does not support
events (callbacks). This `sensealg` assumes that the objective is a long-time averaged
quantity and ergodic, i.e. the time evolution of the system behaves qualitatively the
same over infinite time independent of the specified initial conditions, such that only
the sensitivity with respect to the parameters is of interest.

An implementation of the forward-mode, continuous
[non-intrusive least squares shadowing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00880) method. `NILSS`
allows for computing sensitivities of long-time averaged quantities with respect to the
parameters of an `ODEProblem` by constraining the computation to the unstable subspace.
`NILSS` employs the continuous-time `ForwardSensitivity` method as tangent solver. To
avoid an exponential blow-up of the (homogeneous and inhomogeneous) tangent solutions,
the trajectory should be divided into sufficiently small segments, where the tangent solutions
are rescaled on the interfaces. The computational and memory cost of NILSS scale with
the number of unstable (positive) Lyapunov exponents (instead of the number of states, as
in the LSS method). `NILSS` avoids the explicit construction of the Jacobian at each time
step, and thus should generally be preferred (for large system sizes) over `ForwardLSS`.

## Constructor

```julia

      diff_type = Val{:central},
      autojacvec = autodiff,
      g = nothing)
```

## Arguments

  - `nseg`: Number of segments on full time interval on the attractor.
  - `nstep`: number of steps on each segment.

## Keyword Arguments

  - `nus`: Dimension of the unstable subspace. Default is `nothing`. `nus` must be
    smaller or equal to the state dimension (`length(u0)`). With the default choice,
    `nus = length(u0) - 1` will be set at compile time.
  - `rng`: (Pseudo) random number generator. Used for initializing the homogeneous
    tangent states (`w`). Default is `Xorshifts.Xoroshiro128Plus(rand(UInt64))`.
  - `autodiff`: Use automatic differentiation in the internal sensitivity algorithm
    computations. Default is `true`.
  - `chunk_size`: Chunk size for forward mode differentiation if full Jacobians are
    built (`autojacvec=false` and `autodiff=true`). Default is `0` for automatic
    choice of chunk size.
  - `autojacvec`: Calculate the Jacobian-vector product via automatic
    differentiation with special seeding.
  - `diff_type`: The method used by FiniteDiff.jl for constructing the Jacobian
    if the full Jacobian is required with `autodiff=false`.
  - `g`: instantaneous objective function of the long-time averaged objective.

An implementation of the adjoint-mode, continuous
[non-intrusive adjoint least squares shadowing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08674) method.
`NILSAS` allows for computing sensitivities of long-time averaged quantities with respect
to the parameters of an `ODEProblem` by constraining the computation to the unstable subspace.
`NILSAS` employs SciMLSensitivity.jl's continuous adjoint sensitivity methods on each segment
to compute (homogeneous and inhomogeneous) adjoint solutions. To avoid an exponential blow-up
of the adjoint solutions, the trajectory should be divided into sufficiently small segments,
where the adjoint solutions are rescaled on the interfaces. The computational and memory cost
of NILSAS scale with the number of unstable, adjoint Lyapunov exponents (instead of the number
of states as in the LSS method). `NILSAS` avoids the explicit construction of the Jacobian at
each time step, and thus should generally be preferred (for large system sizes) over `AdjointLSS`.
`NILSAS` is favorable over `NILSS` for many parameters because NILSAS computes the gradient
with respect to multiple parameters with negligible additional cost.

## Constructor

```

## Arguments

  - `nseg`: Number of segments on full time interval on the attractor.
  - `nstep`: number of steps on each segment.
  - `M`: number of homogeneous adjoint solutions. This number must be bigger or equal
    than the number of (positive, adjoint) Lyapunov exponents. Default is `nothing`.

## Keyword Arguments

  - `rng`: (Pseudo) random number generator. Used for initializing the terminate
    conditions of the homogeneous adjoint states (`w`). Default is `Xorshifts.Xoroshiro128Plus(rand(UInt64))`.

  - `adjoint_sensealg`: Continuous adjoint sensitivity method to compute homogeneous
    and inhomogeneous adjoint solutions on each segment. Default is `BacksolveAdjoint(autojacvec=ReverseDiffVJP())`.

      + `autojacvec`: Calculate the vector-Jacobian product (`J'*v`) via automatic

          * `ReverseDiffVJP(compile=false)`: Uses ReverseDiff.jl for the vjp. `compile`
            is a boolean for whether to precompile the tape, which should only be done
            if there are no branches (`if` or `while` statements) in the `f` function.
  - `autodiff`: Use automatic differentiation for constructing the Jacobian
    if the Jacobian needs to be constructed.  Defaults to `true`.

Uses Zygote.jl to compute vector-Jacobian products. Tends to be the fastest VJP method if the
ODE/DAE/SDE/DDE is written with mostly vectorized  functions (like neural networks and other
layers from Flux.jl) and the `f` function is given out-of-place. If the `f` function is
in-place, then `Zygote.Buffer` arrays are used internally, which can greatly reduce the
performance of the VJP method.

Keyword arguments:

  - `allow_nothing`: whether `nothing`s should be implicitly converted to zeros. In Zygote,
    the derivative of a function with respect to `p` which does not use `p` in any possible
    calculation is given a derivative of `nothing` instead of zero. By default, this `nothing`
    is caught in order to throw an informative error message about a potentially unintentional

Uses Enzyme.jl to compute vector-Jacobian products. Is the fastest VJP whenever applicable,
though Enzyme.jl currently has low coverage over the Julia programming language, for example
restricting the user's defined `f` function to not do things like require garbage collection
or calls to BLAS/LAPACK. However, mutation is supported, meaning that in-place `f` with
fully mutating non-allocating code will work with Enzyme (provided no high-level calls to C
like BLAS/LAPACK are used) and this will be the most efficient adjoint implementation.

## Constructor

## Keyword Arguments

  - `chunksize`: the default chunk size for the temporary variables inside the vjp's right
    hand side definition. This is used for compatibility with ODE solves that default to using
    ForwardDiff.jl for the Jacobian of the stiff ODE solve, such as OrdinaryDiffEq.jl. This
    should be set to the maximum chunksize that can occur during an integration to preallocate
    the `DualCaches` for PreallocationTools.jl. It defaults to 0, using `ForwardDiff.pickchunksize`
    but could be decreased if this value is known to be lower to conserve memory.

Uses ReverseDiff.jl to compute the vector-Jacobian products. If `f` is in-place,
then it uses a array of structs formulation to do scalarized reverse mode,
while if `f` is out-of-place, then it uses an array-based reverse mode.

Usually, the fastest when scalarized operations exist in the f function
(like in scientific machine learning applications like Universal Differential Equations)
and the boolean compilation is enabled (i.e. ReverseDiffVJP(true)), if EnzymeVJP fails on
a given choice of `f`.

Does not support GPUs (CuArrays).

## Constructor

```julia
ReverseDiffVJP(compile = false)
```

## Keyword Arguments

  - `compile`: Whether to cache the compilation of the reverse tape. This heavily increases
    the performance of the method, but requires that the `f` function of the ODE/DAE/SDE/DDE
    has no branching.

```julia
ForwardDiffOverAdjoint{A} <: AbstractSecondOrderSensitivityAlgorithm{nothing, true, nothing}
```

ForwardDiff.jl over a choice of `sensealg` method for the adjoint.

## Constructor

```julia
ForwardDiffOverAdjoint(sensealg)
```

## SciMLProblem Support

This supports any SciMLProblem that the `sensealg` choice supports, provided the solver algorithm
is `SciMLBase.isautodifferentiable`.
